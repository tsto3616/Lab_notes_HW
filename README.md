Amplified QLD samples using biolabs monarch tissue DNA isolation kit, labeled QLD1-13 (L3 larvae), amplified for both BZ and ITS2. Then looked at 5 so called hookworm positive dogs and one cat. Only 3 dog samples (TS001-TS003) still had hookworms. They were tested through mcmaster for eggs. If eggs were present then we placed all the liquid from the mcmaster test into a centrifuge vial, spun it down at 3293rpm for 2 min. Eggs were collected from the top to constitute the direct treatment (where there is no further work carried out) and then they were collected from the top again, spun down in water to collect the eggs in a pellet or supernatant. The bottom of the epindorph tube can used for DNA isolation, this was the indirect treatment. Finally poo samples were directly added to the beadbeater tubes for practice.

Our 3 dogs (TS001-TS003) are all greyhounds, 2 from camden and one from Dubbo.

QLD samples sent of for NGS sequencing (results analysed in June). QLD samples renamed as TS.1-TS.13- see one drive for the sample details under the sample file. 

Used faecal DNA kit for isolation of DNA from eggs for the TS001-TS003 samples.
